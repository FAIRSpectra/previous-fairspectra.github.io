      <description>Open question Is these a need for a better file format for our data?
Ideally a file format should be self-describing. Some existing data file formats for SIMS include&amp;hellip;
Spectra-focussed JCAMP-DX SPC VAMAS (ISO 14976:1998 with ISO 22048:2004) Hyperspectral image-focussed imzML Other formats that could be explored include NetCDF HDF5 Apache Arrow Apache Parquet Apache Feather Open questions Which software packages can write these formats? Which software packages can read these formats?</description>

      <description>The FAIR Guiding Principles describe things to consider when making scholarly data available. These are broken down into four interrelated topics: Data and metadata should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
Findability and Accessibility relate to identifiers such as a DOI, and appropriate licencing terms. Interoperability and Reusability recommend that data are stored in a manner that is readable by all, and that information about the data (the metadata) is described in enough detail to be understood by both humans and machines.</description>

      <title>Minimum Reporting Requirement</title>

      <description>This is where we, as a community, decide what information should be reported when we publish our results and our data. This should be the minimum information required to be able to replicate the experiment, and to be able to compare the outcome.
The minimum is just the starting point, more information is always better!</description>

      <description>Semantics is the study of meaning. So that others can understand what we mean, we need wellâ€“defined terminology that we all agree upon.</description>

      <description>Metadata is loosely defined as data about data. This covers everything from:
sample origin, sample pre-treatment, data acquisition, data pre-processing, data analysis. In addition, the order of steps in these general categories is important.
Each of these steps in the analysis pipeline has parameters that can influence the outcome and should be recorded.</description>
