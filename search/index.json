[{"content":"There is now a growing requirement for data acquired on projects supported by national funding programmes to be shared openly. This includes organisations such as UKRI, ERC, Horizon, NIH, NSF, Wellcome, DFG etc.\nSharing data requires that the files must be readable by others and can be understood in terms of their content.\nFAIRSpectra aims to tackle issues with interoperability and reusability, as defined by the FAIR Principles. This has been broken down into two areas of activity: open file formats and metadata vocabulary.\nPlease complete our survey We have put together a short survey on our attitudes to data sharing and how we collect information about our experiments. This survey is anonymous, but there is an option to leave your contact details, if you wish. The survey can be found here.\nJoin the conversation! We are using the Slack platform to discuss all aspects of the FAIRSpectra project. Use this link to join the FAIRSpectra workspace: http://tiny.cc/join-FAIRSpectra\nNeed to know more?
