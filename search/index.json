[{"content":"There is now a growing requirement for data acquired on projects supported by national funding programmes to be shared openly. This includes organisations such as UKRI, ERC, Horizon, NIH, NSF, Wellcome, DFG etc.\nSharing data requires that the files must be readable by others and can be understood in terms of their content.\nFAIRSpectra aims to tackle issues with interoperability and reusability, as defined by the FAIR Principles. This has been broken down into two areas of activity: open file formats and metadata vocabulary.\nJoin the conversation!

These are broken down into four interrelated topics: Data and metadata should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.\nFindability and Accessibility relate to identifiers such as a DOI, and appropriate licencing terms. Interoperability and Reusability recommend that data are stored in a manner that is readable by all, and that information about the data (the metadata) is described in enough detail to be understood by both humans and machines.\n","href":"/docs/fair/","title":"FAIR"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"This is where we, as a community, decide what information should be reported when we publish our results and our data.
